## 🔒 College Data Isolation

Every analytics query is filtered using `college_id`.

A college can access only its own:

* Recruiters
* Students
* Jobs
* Applications
* Onboarding batches
* Analytics

### How Isolation Works

1. Middleware resolves the current college ID.
2. SQL queries filter records using `WHERE college_id = ?`.
3. Cross-college access attempts are blocked.
4. The dashboard runs an isolation verification test.
5. Successful verification displays:

```text
DATA ISOLATION: PASSED
```

### Example Isolation Test Result

```json
{
  "isolationStatus": "PASSED",
  "crossCollegeAccess": false,
  "message": "College data isolation verified successfully."
}
```

This proves that one college cannot access another college's placement data.

---

## 🛡️ Data Quality Checks

The Data Trust Center performs multiple automated checks.

### 1. Freshness Check

Verifies that recent data exists within the expected time range.

**PASSED** indicates that dashboard data is current.

### 2. Null Check

Checks important fields including:

* Recruiter email
* Student email
* College ID
* Application status

**PASSED** indicates that required fields do not contain unexpected null values.

### 3. Duplicate Check

Checks for:

* Duplicate student emails within the same college
* Duplicate recruiter emails within the same college

**PASSED** indicates that no unexpected duplicates were detected.

### 4. Suspicious Spike Check

Detects unusually large changes in:

* Applications
* Onboarding activity

**PASSED** indicates normal activity levels.

### 5. College Isolation Check

Verifies that cross-college data cannot be returned.

**PASSED** confirms successful college-level data isolation.

## 🎬 2-Minute Demo Script

### Step 1 — Introduction

> "This is the finalized Recruiter Command Center. All metrics are calculated from persisted recruiter, student, job, application, and bulk onboarding data."

### Step 2 — KPI Cards

> "The top KPIs show total recruiters, active recruiters, total students, successfully onboarded students, jobs, applications, hires, conversion rate, and average time to hire. Every number comes directly from the SQLite database."

### Step 3 — Hiring Funnel

> "The hiring funnel shows where candidates are dropping out of the recruitment process and helps identify conversion bottlenecks."

### Step 4 — Top Recruiters

> "Recruiters are ranked using actual job and application outcomes, not manually assigned scores."

### Step 5 — Bulk Onboarding

> "The Bulk Onboarding section shows whether student uploads are succeeding, failing, or creating duplicate records with batch-level details."

### Step 6 — Recruiter Performance

> "The Recruiter Performance table supports search, filtering, and sorting while showing jobs, applications, interviews, offers, hires, and conversion rates."

### Step 7 — Actionable Insights

> "The Actionable Insights section converts dashboard metrics into decisions by identifying inactive recruiters, weak job conversion, and onboarding issues."

### Step 8 — Data Trust Center

> "The Data Trust Center checks data freshness, null values, duplicate records, suspicious spikes, and overall data quality."

### Step 9 — College Data Isolation

> "Every query is filtered by college ID. The isolation test proves that one college cannot access another college's recruiter, student, job, application, or onboarding data."

### Step 10 — Final Verification

> "The Metric Dictionary explains the source and calculation of every important KPI, while CSV export and print reporting make the dashboard fully demoable and ready for hand-off."
